# Orthopedics Analytics Dashboard 
**A Comprehensive Data Analysis and Visualization Project**  
---

## Overview  
This project showcases my expertise in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization by transforming raw healthcare data into actionable insights. The **Orthopedics Analytics Dashboard** is a dynamic Excel-based tool designed to analyze patient data for an orthopedic department. Starting from raw data, I performed end-to-end data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and dashboard creation to provide key metrics and insights for healthcare decision-making.  

This project demonstrates my ability to:  
- Clean and preprocess raw data for analysis.  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.  
- Create interactive dashboards for stakeholder-friendly reporting.  
- Answer critical questions using data-driven insights.

## Key Features of the Dashboard  
1. **Patient Demographics Overview**:  
   - Total number of patients.  
   - Distribution of patients by age brackets.  
   - Gender and race breakdowns.  

2. **Patient Satisfaction Analysis**:  
   - Average patient satisfaction score (PSAT).  
   - Correlation between patient wait times and satisfaction scores.  

3. **Operational Insights**:  
   - Average patient wait times.  
   - Referral patterns by department.  
   - Flagged administrative cases for further review.

## Data Source  
The dataset was sourced from [Chris French's GitHub repository](https://github.com/chrisfrenchjr/SQLQueries/blob/main/Orthopedic%20Dashboard.xlsx). It includes the following columns:  
- `date`  
- `patient_id`  
- `patient_gender`  
- `patient_age`  
- `patient_sat_score`  
- `patient_last_name`  
- `patient_race`  
- `patient_admin_flag`  
- `patient_waittime`  
- `department_referral`

## Methodology  
1. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Handled missing values and inconsistencies.  
   - Standardized data formats (e.g., date, age brackets).  
   - Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Analyzed patient demographics (age, gender, race).  
   - Investigated the relationship between wait times and satisfaction scores.  
   - Identified trends in department referrals and administrative flags.  

3. **Dashboard Creation**:  
   - Designed an interactive Excel dashboard with pivot tables and charts.  
   - Included filters for dynamic data exploration (e.g., by age, gender, department).  
   - Visualized key metrics using bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots.

## Insights Delivered  
- **Patient Satisfaction**: Identified a moderate negative correlation between wait times and satisfaction scores, suggesting that reducing wait times could improve patient experience.  
- **Age Distribution**: The majority of patients fell within the 01-80 age bracket, indicating a need for targeted orthopedic services for children, middle-aged, and older adults.  
- **Operational Efficiency**: Highlighted departments with the highest referral rates and longest wait times, providing actionable insights for resource allocation.

## Why This Project Stands Out  
- **End-to-End Ownership**: From raw data to a polished dashboard, this project demonstrates my ability to handle the entire data analysis lifecycle.  
- **Healthcare Focus**: The project addresses real-world healthcare challenges, making it highly relevant for roles in healthcare analytics.  
- **Recruiter-Friendly**: The dashboard is visually appealing, easy to navigate, and provides actionable insights‚Äîqualities that recruiters and hiring managers value.

## Tools Used  
- **Excel**: Data cleaning, analysis, and dashboard creation.  
- **Pivot Tables and Charts**: For dynamic data summarization and visualization.  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Correlation analysis and descriptive statistics.
